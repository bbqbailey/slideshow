listDuplicatesFromList-v0-1.py - List duplicate filenames from duplicates.txt (v0-1)

DESCRIPTION
    Version: v0-1

    This script is a READ-ONLY duplicate reporter. It does NOT move or modify
    any files.

    It expects a file named 'duplicates.txt' in the SAME directory as this
    script. Each non-empty line in duplicates.txt must be a FULL ABSOLUTE
    PATH to an image file (as produced by makeDuplicatesTXT-v0-1.py).

    You pass a BASE SEARCH ROOT as arg1 (e.g.
        /media/Entertainment/Photos/PictureAlbums
    ) and the script will walk that tree ONCE, looking for files whose
    BASENAME matches any of the basenames from duplicates.txt.

    It then groups by BASENAME and reports ONLY those basenames that were
    found in 2 or more locations under the search root.

    Example output:

        [GROUP] IMG_1234.jpg (count: 3)
            /path/A/IMG_1234.jpg
            /path/B/IMG_1234.jpg
            /path/C/IMG_1234.jpg

    RULES / BEHAVIOR
        * Any directory named exactly 'slideshow_exclude' is skipped entirely
          while walking the search root.
        * No files are moved, deleted, or changed in any way.
        * A timestamped log file is created in the script directory:
              listDuplicatesFromList-v0-1_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
          All screen output is also written to this log.
